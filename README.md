## About Me

Hello! I'm Jack J Burleson (also known by the pen name Lucius J Morningstar), a passionate researcher and developer at the intersection of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and clinical psychology. My work spans multiple disciplines, combining cutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of the human mind.

### üß† Neuroscience & Computational Neuroscience

My fascination with the brain's intricate workings drives my research in neuroscience. I'm particularly interested in:

- Neural network modeling
- Brain-computer interfaces
- Cognitive processes and their computational analogues

### ü§ñ Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

I leverage ML and AI techniques to push the boundaries of what's possible in neuroscience and psychology:

- Deep learning architectures for brain signal analysis
- Reinforcement learning models of decision-making
- AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment planning in mental health

### üí¨ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

My work in NLP focuses on:

- Sentiment analysis in clinical settings
- Automated analysis of therapy transcripts
- Language models for mental health chatbots

### üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Clinical Psychology
